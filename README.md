## Overview
BiteWise is a recipe recommendation system that leverages generative AI to suggest meals based on your available ingredients, calorie limits, dietary restrictions, allergies, and preferred cuisines. It supports both manual ingredient input and image uploads for ingredient detection, making meal planning effortless and sustainable.

## Features
- **Ingredient-Based Recipe Suggestions**: Generate recipes using only the ingredients you have, reducing the need for extra shopping.
- **Calorie-Conscious Recommendations**: Filter recipes to meet your specified calorie goals for healthier eating.
- **Dietary Customization & Allergies**: Accommodate dietary preferences (e.g., vegan, keto, gluten-free) and avoid allergens (e.g., nuts, dairy).
- **Global Cuisine Exploration**: Discover recipes from various culinary traditions (e.g., Italian, Mexican, Indian) using your ingredients.
- **Detailed Recipe Information**: Access full preparation instructions and nutritional breakdowns for suggested recipes.
- **Photo & Manual Ingredient Input**: Upload images of your fridge/pantry for AI-powered ingredient detection or manually enter ingredients for flexibility.

## Problem Statement
Many people struggle to cook meals due to limited time, leftover ingredients, and personal constraints like dietary restrictions, allergies, or calorie goals. Scrolling through countless recipes online is time-consuming and inefficient. BiteWise addresses this by:
- Using your pantry as the primary search space.
- Filtering recipes based on calories, allergies, and dietary preferences in one go.
- Delivering quick, clear, and tailored recipe suggestions to save time and reduce waste.

- **Culinary Explorers**: Try new global recipes with familiar ingredients.
- **Busy Individuals**: Get quick, simple recipes with minimal prep.
- **Sustainability-Focused Users**: Reduce food waste and use seasonal/local items.

## How It Works

   - Upload a photo of your fridge/pantry, and BiteWise's computer vision identifies ingredients.
   - Alternatively, manually select or enter ingredients.
2. **Set Preferences**:
   - Specify calorie limits, dietary preferences, allergies, and preferred cuisines.
3. **Get Recipes**:
   - The AI generates a list of recipes tailored to your inputs, including names, ingredients, and estimated calories.
